# GraphGamesPython

GraphGamesPython is a collection of three math-based games designed to help users practice and learn key mathematical concepts interactively. These games include a scatter plot game, an algebra practice game, and a projectile game. The project is implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Games Overview

### 1. Scatter Plot Game
Randomly generate points on a graph and the player has to input the (x,y) coordinates. For added difficulty, the graph can be larger.
- **Objective:** Identify the coordinates of randomly placed points on the graph.
- **Features:**
  - Random point generation.
  - User input for guessing coordinates.
  - Score tracking for multiple rounds.

### 2. Algebra Practice Game
Generate one-step and two-step problems with random integer values, and the player has to input the answer. Use positive and negative values. For added difficulty, the numbers can be larger.
- **Objective:** Solve algebraic equations.
- **Features:**
  - One-step and two-step algebra problems.
  - Random generation of integers for problems.
  - User input for answers and correctness checking.
  - Score tracking for multiple rounds.

### 3. Projectile Game
Display a "wall" with random height and location. The player has to move sliders to adjust a parabolic path to clear the wall. For added difficulty, players can enter `a`, `b`, and `c` without sliders.
- **Objective:** Determine the initial velocity required for a projectile to clear a wall.
- **Features:**
  - Random wall height and location generation.
  - Interactive sliders for adjusting projectile path parameters.
  - Visualization of projectile path and wall.
  - Score tracking based on successful attempts.
